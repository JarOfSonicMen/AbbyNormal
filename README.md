65%+TK Ortho Keyboard that uses normal keycaps
Inspired by the FoldKB split keyboard that uses conventional keycaps, I decided to
implement a nonsplit version of it, but with a numpad as well, so it's a bit like
an ortholinear 96% keyboard but without the dedicated arrow keys. I figured that
I didn't need the arrow keys, I would just use the numpad as my arrows and nav
keys, with a temp or lockable number layer as well. I suppose you can use it as
you like.

This PCB has not been fully (or at all) tested, and is provided as-is for use at
your own risk.
